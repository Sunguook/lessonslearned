In order to hire the best programmers, it is important to identify the essential technical skills, but it is also important to consider personal qualities as well.
We need to make sure that the programmer can stay with the firm in a long run or at least until the company reaches a stable point.
In order to do so, we need to check to see if the long term goals of the company is aligned with the that of the programmer.
Some of these interests might be related to career advancement, immediate and long term financial interests, and quality of projects.
Some programmers might be world class in skills, but may not be a good fit to the firm.
Checking to see if the programmer is a good fit to the company culture is as important as his or her technical skills.
